          <span>Names</span> like Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. are all names that most people recognize and associate with the leaders of the civil rights movement in the 60’s.  These leaders are known for their acts of defiance against unjust laws and their powerful speeches that gained them a fallowing. They dedicated their lives to the movement and have earned a spot in history for doing so. Currently we have popular leaders that aim to progress the LGBTQ+ movement as well, but they are a little different from the leaders previously mentioned.

          <span>In</span> the LGBTQ+ there are leaders that have dedicated a majority of their time to the movement through leading organizations like the Gay Straight Alliance and Heritage of Pride. While these leaders have made strides for the movement by spreading awareness, they are less well known than the leaders of the Civil Rights movement. Instead the LGBTQ+ has pop culture leaders like Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Ellen Degeneres who use their platform as celebrities to spread awareness.
        </p>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Miley</span> Cyrus and Lady Gaga both started out as only singers, but have since used their voice and their followers to spread awareness for the LGBTQ+. Miley Cyrus has come out as pansexual and Lady Gaga has come out as bisexual, both publicly putting themselves in the LGBTQ+ community, not just as its allies. On top of this, Miley Cyrus started the #instapride campaign with instagram to give transgender people a platform to raise awareness of their struggles. She also started the Happy Hippie foundation to rally young people to fight social injustices towards vulnerable groups like the transgender community. Lady Gaga has spoken about equality at many of concerts and also at the 2009 National Equality March on Washington DC. She also made public speeches opposing the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” US policy.

        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>It</span> seems that the current leaders who are only known for their support of a movement, like the LGBTQ+ movement, get less recognition than the leaders who establish themselves through another medium first and then use their platform to progress a movement. This phenomenon could be a result of newer generations being more focused on entertainment than current issues. With the fast paced media surrounding us today, someone making speeches may not be as captivating as it was 50 years ago.

          <span>The</span> purpose of this section is to discuss different leaders from the civil rights movement and the LGBTQ+ movement and how their hardships may have shaped them as leaders. The other purpose is to celebrate them as leaders who were able to overcome extreme difficulties and progress in their movement.

        <h3>Malcolm X</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Malcolm X</span> had a very eventful life that included many hardships which started at a young age. He grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, where his father preached about the countries oppression of African Americans. The KKK knew of his father and would make frequent rides to their house making death threats and harassing them. As a result the family was forced to move twice, but eventually their house was burned down and his father was murdered and found dead on the town trolley tracks. His mother was admitted to a mental institution soon after, and Malcolm and his siblings were split up then put into various foster homes and orphanages by child services. In his young adult years, Malcolm became a troubled man going down  a bad path, getting involved with hustlers, becoming addicted to cocaine and building a reputation for himself as trigger happy. Eventually he was caught for robbery and sentenced to prison for ten years.
        </p>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>In prison,</span> Malcolm learned about the religious teachings of Elijah Muhammad, a leader of the Nation of Islam. Malcolm was able to completely turn his life around through his new faith. He gave up the life of crime and drugs and focused on making the world a better place for African Americans. When he was let out of jail he began preaching for the Nation of Islam about black oppression and white men being the devil. This extreme idea of white men being evil is not so extreme keeping in mind the the awful tragedies he was put through and had seen at a young age as a result of the white supremacist society he lived in. After establishing himself in the NAtion of Islam, it came out that his leader, Elijah Muhammad, had multiple affairs with women. The news may have not seemed so bad for some, but for Malcolm, it wasB like witnessing someone so close to God fall from their morality. Instead of acting like nothing happened, like most of the leaders in the Nation of Islam, Malcolm left the organization and started his own. He traveled to Mecca and learned that not all white people are evil. He came back to America with a new message for his followers about how they must work together to gain equality. Malcolm proved that he could be the type of leader that can change their ways and also stand up for what is right even if it goes against what they had believed for so long.

        <h3>Harvey Milk</h3>

        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>After</span> being elected into the board of supervisors in San Francisco, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay official. The road to being an official, as well as the first openly gay one,  was not an easy one to take in the 70’s. He ran for the supervisor three times, failing twice before and receiving death threats from homophobic opposition. Running for the position multiple times put a lot of stress on his relationship with his boyfriend. Eventually, his boyfriend gave him an ultimatum after the second loss: if Milk ran again they could no longer be together. Milk was split, but in the end chose to run again, knowing he had a really good chance of winning this time and that could help the homosexual community all over the country. In the end he won and his boyfriend did leave him. The relationship troubles were not done though, as Harvey ran into new problems with his next boyfriend. His next boyfriend would make suicide threats if he felt Harvey was putting in more time and effort into his work, rather than into their relationship. Again Harvey stayed dedicated to his cause selflessly knowing he could be improving many lives rather than just his own and the people closest to him.

        <h3>Danica Roem</h3>
        <div className="Leaders-portrait">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Danica Roem</span> is a transgender woman, who was elected into the house of Delegates in Virginia this year (2017). During her campaign she ran against Bob Marshall who had been in the position for 13 terms. Marshall had labelled himself as “the chief homophobe” and had also supported the limitation of bathroom use for transgender people based on gender identity. So not only was Danica up against someone who the constituents of Virginia had elected 13 times, she was up against someone who did not accept her for who she is. In public debates he constantly misgendered her, bringing the focus away from her campaign directed at helping the state, and bringing the focus towards something that should not matter. Through all this, Danica won the election and when asked about Bob Marshall she tweeted “I do not attack my constituents. Bob is my constituent now.” Danica Roem proved herself to be the type of leader to not get hung up on debates that do not focus on her goal.

        <h2>What They Have Done</h2>
        <h3>Harvey Milk</h3>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Harvey Milk</span> gave inspiring speeches to rally his followers and show the world what the gay and lesbian community wanted and deserved as citizens of the United States. Here is one speech demonstrating his ability to  give emotionally powerful  speeches:

        </iframe>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Not</span> only was he able to give powerful speeches, he was able to  perform very well in public debates. He strategically would cater his style to his audience. When debating in front of his supporters he would use humor to make his opponent look ridiculous. The laughter he received from his humor made it appear that he was winning the debates. When debating in front of people who opposed him and his ideas, he would be clever to try and confuse his opponent or make them contradict themselves. He strategically knew that using humor in a crowd of opponents would not go over well, even if he was actually being really funny.

        <h3>Dan Savage</h3>

        </div>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Dan Savage</span> started the “It Gets Better Project” to prevent suicide among LGBTQ+ youth. The project uses youtube as a platform to share over 650 videos of diverse groupings of LGBTQ+ people explaining how early life is not everything and as time goes on life will get better. He also began HUMP festivals, which are amatuer pornography showings, put on to celebrate the desires of all people. Most people watching the festival, start off extremely uncomfortable, only noting the differences between them and the actors on the screen, but eventually they begin to notice similarities including desire, vulnerability, and humor. The festival is definitely out there, but is a very interesting way of making people more comfortable with ideas they previously found unnatural.

        <h3>Ellen Degeneres</h3>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Ellen Degeneres</span> is another leader in the LGBTQ+ movement,  mostly known for her talk show Ellen. She is also largely recognized for coming out on her previous show and also in real life in the late 90’s. Ellen did not want to have a political agenda with her show revolving around a lesbian agenda, and instead wanted to only share love and acceptance. Instead she her shown was labeled as inappropriate for children and soon after was cancelled.
        </p>
        <p className="Leaders-intro">
          <span>Although</span> the cancellation was tragic, Ellen persevered, eventually creating her popular talk show Ellen, which in 2010 was being viewed by 2.9 million viewers per program. Ellen has recognized the popularity and used it to spread awareness for the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community. She makes sure to include a variety of the groups within the LGBTQ+, as many only focus on the  “L” and “G”. Ellen has invited a transgender student and a transgender couple to come on the show to speak about the struggles of being in those positions. She has also brought in a woman whose father had transitioned to being a woman, to speak on what that was like for her and her family. Spreading awareness for the personal struggles of people within these vulnerable groups helps immensely with acceptance because many who reject the groups do not actually know much about them in the first place.
